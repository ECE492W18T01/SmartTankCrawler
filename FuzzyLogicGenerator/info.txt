Fuzzy Logic System for Servo Steering.
Generated using MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Designer System.
Graphs added in report.

For use, in MATLAB, with Fuzzy Logic Extension Installed, call 
generateDecisionMatrices('servoFuzzyLogic')
And then run (with Bash and GCC) 
gcc testFuzzyCRead.c fMatrices_servoFuzzyLogic.h -o readFuzz -std=c99 -Wall
And see the executable C file that reads the entire array, basically a 
proof that it can be inserted into MicroC/OS-II and read.
