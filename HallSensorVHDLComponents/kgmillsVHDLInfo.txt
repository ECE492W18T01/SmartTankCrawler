Contains VHDL files and testbenches for the Hall Sensor slip detection system.

As of 2/3/18 it contains:
samplingClock.vhd - A downscaling clock that goes from the FPGA's 50MHz to the 10-1Hz we need for our purposes.
hall_sensor_accumulator.vhd - Counts incoming edges from a hall sensor and sends them off for processing.
hall_sensor_comparator.vhd - Processes the information from hall_sensor_accumulator
